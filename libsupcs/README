libsupcs is the support library for all non trivial code compiled by tysila

It is mainly responsible for dealing with RTTI and also contains placeholders
for system-specific functionality that is implemented by tysila (e.g. the
ability to perform IO port read/writes).  It does not have any dependencies
on underlying libraries except those which define System.Type and the like.
